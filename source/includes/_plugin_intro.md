# Plugins

Plugins are bundles that can extend the functionality of Mautic. They can be very simple or very complex and have access to leverage pretty much all that Symfony offers. Just as as reminder, the basics are covered in this document. If more advanced processes are required, the [Symfony book](http://symfony.com/doc/2.8/book/index.html) and [cookbook](http://symfony.com/doc/2.8/cookbook/index.html) will be valuable resources.

<aside class="notice">
Mautic plugins are located in the plugins/ directory and must be namespaced with MauticPlugin.
